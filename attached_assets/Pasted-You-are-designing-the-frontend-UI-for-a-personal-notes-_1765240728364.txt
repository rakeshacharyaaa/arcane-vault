You are designing the frontend UI for a personal notes app called **Arcane Vault**.

Goal:
Create a single-page React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS UI with a **black-themed, glassmorphism, dark aesthetic**. No backend logic, just UI and basic state. The UI should feel like a calm, magical, personal vault.

Tech:
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (v4-compatible)
- No Next.js-specific features (no app/router, no getServerSideProps, etc.)
- Return a single root component (e.g. App.tsx) plus any child components if needed.

Overall Layout:
The layout is split into two main sections:

1. Left Panel: “Vault Sidebar”
   - Width ~ 25–30% on desktop, full width stacked on mobile.
   - Contains:
     - App logo / name at top: “Arcane Vault” with a small glowing dot icon.
     - A search bar for notes.
     - A scrollable list of note previews.
   - Each note preview:
     - Glassmorphism card:
       - `bg-white/5`, `backdrop-blur-xl`
       - `border border-white/10`
       - soft `shadow-xl shadow-black/40`
     - Shows:
       - Note title
       - 1–2 line snippet of content
       - Created date in small text
       - Tags as small pill chips (`bg-white/10`, `text-xs`, `rounded-full`, `border border-white/10`)
     - Hover: subtle lift + glow (`hover:bg-white/10`, `hover:border-emerald-400/60`).
     - Selected note: stronger border + subtle inner glow.

2. Right Panel: “Editor”
   - Takes remaining width on desktop, full width below sidebar on mobile.
   - Glassmorphism editor card in the center:
     - `bg-white/5`, `backdrop-blur-2xl`, `rounded-2xl`, `border border-white/10`, `shadow-2xl shadow-black/50`
     - Padding and breathing room.
   - Contains:
     - Title input (large, subtle underline or border, full width).
     - Multiline textarea for note content (flex-1, auto-resizing or large height).
     - Tags input: single input where user types comma-separated tags.
     - At the top-right or bottom-right:
       - “New note” button (to clear form for a fresh note).
       - “Save” button (primary, glowing emerald accent).
       - Optional “Delete” button when a note is selected (accented in red).
   - Small text indicator like “Last updated just now” or “Auto-saved” at bottom.

Design & Styling Requirements:
- Background:
  - Full-screen, vertical gradient from near-black to slightly lighter black.
  - Example: `from-neutral-950 via-black to-neutral-900`.
- Typography:
  - Use Tailwind’s default sans but style it to feel elegant:
    - `font-sans`, `tracking-tight`, `antialiased`.
- Glassmorphism:
  - Consistent use of `bg-white/5`, `bg-white/10`, `backdrop-blur-md` to `backdrop-blur-2xl`.
  - Borders: `border-white/10`, `border-white/5` where appropriate.
  - Shadows: `shadow-lg shadow-black/40`.
- Accent color:
  - Emerald / teal glow: `text-emerald-400`, `border-emerald-400/60`, `shadow-emerald-500/40`.
- Micro-interactions:
  - Use Tailwind transitions:
    - `transition`, `duration-200`, `ease-out`.
  - Hover states for buttons and cards:
    - Slight scale, slight glow, subtle color shift.
- Overall feel:
  - Calm, minimal, magical.
  - No harsh borders, no sharp contrasting colors other than accents.
  - Avoid clutter, keep things clean and focused.

State & Mock Data:
- Use React state only on the client.
- Create a mock array of notes in code with:
  - id, title, content, tags, createdAt.
- Allow:
  - Clicking a note in the sidebar selects it and populates the editor.
  - “New note” clears the editor fields to create a new note.
  - “Save” updates the selected note in local state or adds a new note if none is selected.
  - “Delete” removes the selected note from the list.
- Search:
  - Typing in the search bar filters the notes list by title or content (case-insensitive).

Responsiveness:
- On desktop: Sidebar on left, editor on right, horizontally side-by-side.
- On tablet/mobile: Stack vertically (sidebar on top, editor below).
- Use Tailwind responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:`) to handle layout changes.

Structure:
- You can create small components like:
  - `<Sidebar />`
  - `<NoteList />`
  - `<NoteListItem />`
  - `<Editor />`
  - `<TagChip />`
- But keep everything in a simple structure so it’s easy to drop into a Vite + React + Tailwind project.

Important:
- Do NOT add any external UI libraries.
- Do NOT include any backend calls or API logic.
- Focus 100% on UI and local mock state with TypeScript types.
- The result should look like a polished, production-ready dark glassmorphism notes app called Arcane Vault.

Return only the relevant React + TypeScript + Tailwind code (components and any styles) in a way that I can easily copy into a Vite + React + Tailwind project.
